UPDATE page_text SET text = 'The wondrous gift of magic can be bent to many purposes. We the learned have found that it is easiest to divide the eldritch arts into eight different categories in order to further understand the fundamentals of magic itself. Each of these categories is known as a \'school\' of magic, for they are often learned separately and mages frequently choose to specialize in one type or another. Other mages attempt to master all forms of magic, but few have achieved this lofty goal. Within this tome we will discuss each individual school of magic and some of their notable practitioners.' WHERE entry = '3359';
UPDATE page_text SET text = 'All schools of magic can be combined to create formidable spells that utilize multiple sources of power. Some of these potent spells are discussed later in this series of books, but beware, combining multiple types of magic can be extremely dangerous - especially for beginners.\r\n\r\n	Here you will learn the basics of all schools of magic. Please remember that magic is not to be abused. Do not practice magic without the appropriate supervision.' WHERE entry = '3360';

UPDATE page_text SET text = 'Abjuration is the study of protective magic and one of the most important schools for a young mage to study. The most generalized abjuration spell is the mana shield, a spell that transmutes raw mana into a barrier that protects the caster from attacks. Properly executed, this spell can protect the mage against even the most formidable of attacks - but the mana shield is very difficult for a novice to master. It often takes a mage months of practice to even conjure a simple mana shield, and thus, more basic alternatives exist.\r\n' WHERE entry = '3362';
UPDATE page_text SET text = 'A series of \'elemental armor\' spells were invented to aid the traveling mage in the unfortunate case that he or she might be attacked. These spells require far less raw energy to cast than a mana shield and are more easily maintained over time, but lack the raw potency of the mana shield. Rather than stopping an attack completely, a frost armor spell might simply decrease the effectiveness of the assault. The more advanced armor spells grant other benefits - for example, the potent mage armor spell actually assists the caster in regaining magical power more easily.' WHERE entry = '3363';
UPDATE page_text SET text = 'Practitioners of the arcane arts are often ambitious, and we frequently find ourselves in situations where magic may slip just slightly beyond our control. It is for this reason that the \'Ward\' spells exist. Ward spells are quick, potent incantations to protect the caster against a form of elemental damage - damage which is often caused by the caster attempting one of the other schools of magic. This is why studying abjuration early is so imperative.' WHERE entry = '3364';
UPDATE page_text SET text = 'One of the most renowned practitioners of Abjuration magic is Prince Kael\'thas Sunstrider. While the prince is quite formidable in all schools of magic, Kael\'thas has created a variation of Mana Shield that is practically unsurpassed in among the residents of Dalaran. Also notable is the Arcanist Doan, who has perfected a spell that combines Evocation and Abjuration to shield himself for a short time while preparing a powerful area-of-effect spell. This \'Detonate\' spell provides Doan with a degree of near invulnerability for a precious few seconds, but few mages have the capacity to cast it safely.' WHERE entry = '3365';

UPDATE page_text SET text = 'Magnataur - The enormous magnataur have little to no magical affinity.  Magnataur casters are very rare, and tend to be follow a shamanic route if they practice magic at all.  I can tell you first-hand, however, that they won\'t go down without a fight, and their thick hides can withstand several of the most powerful frostbolts.\n\nVrykul - While Northrend\'s half-giants naturally know little to no magic, some have been trained in necromancy by the Lich King. I have also heard rumors of \'rune magic\' of some kind, but I have not yet had the opportunity to research this intriguing subject in depth.\n' WHERE entry = '3534';

UPDATE page_text SET text = 'At the age of 12, Antonidas\' thesis, \'The Ramifications of Refining Reverse Time Travel Phenomena into Quantifiable Magical Practice\' earned him the Kirin Tor Sash of Supreme Acumen, the youngest ever to receive the award. Shortly thereafter the Ruling Council offered him official placement in the Kirin Tor Advanced Research and Illumination Sect, also the youngest to receive an official invitation.' WHERE entry = '3404';
UPDATE page_text SET text = 'After the Second War, Antonidas investigated the lethargy of the orcs.  The archmage published several theses on his research:\r\n\r\n\'The Causality of War: A Comprehensive Study on Orc Lassitude.\'\r\n\r\n\'The Contrast of Orc Tradition, Sociology, and Psychological Practices from Before and After the Second War.\'\r\n\r\n\'Empirical Study on the Formulation and History of High Profile Fel Magics, and their Relation to the Orc Race.\'' WHERE entry = '3407';

UPDATE page_text SET text = '...It\'s not so much an echo as it is a comforting voice in my head, reassuring me that there\'s more to come.  It feels like the opposite of a headache (if that makes any sense), a wave of warmth and ideas.
