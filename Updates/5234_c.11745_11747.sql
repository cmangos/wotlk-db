-- Cyclone Warrior 11745 / Desert Rager 11747
-- we have wps only for 2 of them (100% they're more)
-- also i found, that they share spawn points (+ the same paths). 
-- Only question is - if theres smth more, like spawn Cyclone Warrior 
-- only when air invasion is ON.. or smth like that...
-- this need to be confirmed one day.
